# DDoS Attack Detection

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model to analyze network traffic patterns and forecast Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which pose a serious threat to network security.

## Features

1. **LSTM-based Analysis**: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory networks to analyze and predict patterns in network traffic that may indicate an impending DDoS attack.

2. **Feature Selection**: Implements Chi-Square test for optimal feature selection, enhancing the model's performance.

3. **Real-time Testing**: Demonstrated model performance in a real-time simulated botnet attack against a web application in a virtual machine environment.

### Technology Stack

- TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy
- VMWare Virtual Machine (For testing)
